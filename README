TODO:

Create an app that allows us to: 

1. login with a username and password - Done 
2. and view a stream of tweets pertaining to a twitter handle associated with our user
3. make sure you can't access the tweets page unless you're logged in - Done

4. bonus one: ability to send tweets from a form as well

5. bonus two: make sure the stream of tweets can't be viewed in any way, unless you're logged in (ex. you can't log out from one tab and still see them in another)

6. update the UI to be user friendly and (just a tiny bit) attractive

superbonus: make the app work for multiple users at the same time.
